bugs:

an antenna placed on a black tile spawns a green control ray. why?


neutral energy is created and is the only kind of energy that gets created
red and blue energy is translated from neutral energy

the antenna needs to take some amount of its hc and make a control ray out of it.
closer to the source stronger, farther weaker
the selected target is the focus point, it always tries to reach all the way there

...
hex control refactor:
give hc an idea of velocity so that it can move in a direction


minimum interesting game:

building stuff costs resources, can only be done within a range of the player
resources come from a power station and are converted to control

player starts with control over one power station, there's a little enemy fort that they need to destroy


refactor all energy to come from neutral
add power station
add power converter







Soon:


the control ray need to be reworked.
the player control hex doesn't make sense
add unit that creates small hex control field

make minimum interesting map

update hexmap to be not dumb

add a character that is less terrible

add a pause game

add an off button to antenna


Not soon:

Balance the game

Add hostile player AI
